# VueKb

A customisable Knowledgebase app in Vuejs.

Using Vue and Buefy (Bulma) for component styling. With options for using Firebase or a custom API datastore.

## Config

You can find a config file (kb.config.js) in the root of the src directory. It is also imported as a global mixin to make options available in the app as computed properties.

| Name | Description | Type | Values | Default |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| articleContent | Will you be providing Articles? | Boolean  | true / false | true |
| faqContent | Will you be providing FAQs? | Boolean  | true / false | true |
| datastore | What kind of datastore will you be using | String | firebase / api / vuex / json | firebase |

### Datastore

Depending on what option you select (from 3 currently available) different actions will be loaded into the Vuex store.

#### Firebase (default)

Allows you to setup and use a Firebase realtime database for populating your vuex store with data.

#### API

Allows you to configure an external or same host API service for populating your vuex store with data.

#### Vuex

Allows you to use hard-coded data in your app, directly stored in the state variable in the vuex store.

#### JSON

TODO: write spec for using JSON imports as data store.

article: {
  id: UUID | Integer,

## FAQs
